3A. dbt next steps for you
If your organization is thinking about using dbt, how would you pitch the value of dbt/analytics engineering to a decision maker at your organization?
    I think one of the biggest values that dbt/analytics engineering brings is the ability to build re-usable components that can be used as building blocks for complex models for a wide variety of purposes across an organization.  That then allows you to both make broad changes improving the model for everyone at once, while also providing for additional flexibility in tailoring the models to a specific purpose.

    On top of that, dbt can build extensive, high-level documentation with little effort.

    The use of dbt also allows for easier collaboration between individuals by allowing modeling to be iterated, versioned, and merged, like software.
